What's it's about
======================
The purpose of the project is to study the movement patterns of the European Free-tailed Bat (Tadarida teniotis), aim to characterize its seasonal movements within the area, which is mostly unknown. This species (family Molossidae) appears and disappears from roosting sites, in a seemingly randomly pattern. It is capable of flying long distances (estimated 100â€™s km per night), and therefore very hard to be tracked with ordinary tools. Former studies examined the absence and presence of it in a few roosting colonies, but last only 1-2 seasons and were limited to 1-3 sites.
With public participation, and the aid of long term monitoring devices, a continuous (both in terms of time and open spaces) sampling will be achieved. The general public will take a significant part in data collection. Data related to the presence and absence of Tadaridas, from all around the area, will be recorded using a web application that has been developed for this propose. Remote sites will be monitored by passive recording devices. The bioacoustics data analysis will be done by professionals from Tel-Aviv University. 
It is the first project that following movement patterns of bat populations over long periods of time, with such a significant public involvement.
